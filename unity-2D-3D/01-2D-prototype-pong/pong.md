Goals:
Create an arena with two walls and a divider.
Add a paddle on either end of the play field. Use player inputs to move the paddles up and down.
Add a ball that moves around the playfield and bounces off of the paddles and walls.
Detect when the ball leaves the playfield. Assign a point to the player who scored.
Track and display the score for each player.

Stretch goals:
Write an AI script that can follow the ball so you can play with only one player.
Hint: Following the ball with a paddle is easy, but it makes the opponent impossible to beat. You might want to make the AI less than perfect somehow.
Add a menu and allow the player to reset the game.
Add some basic sounds. Play a sound every time the ball collides with something, and every time a player scores.
